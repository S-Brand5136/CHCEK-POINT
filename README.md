# CHECK-POINT üïπÔ∏è

Track and get stats of games you play, how long you've played, and browse a catalog of games with CHECK-POINT !
<br />
<br />
This video game tracker app has a catalogue for any user to browse through games, and view details on specific titles they‚Äôre interested in. Users can add ratings to the game, which will contribute to the game‚Äôs overall rating as well as their profile stats. On the main feed, users can view their collections of games they‚Äôre currently playing, wanting to play, have completed, and have dropped, as well as view other user‚Äôs activity. Outside of collections, users are also able to create their own lists of their choosing, and add games to them accordingly.
